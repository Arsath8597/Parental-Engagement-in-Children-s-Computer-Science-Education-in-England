    title: "What is Computational Thinking (and Why It Matters)",
    content: `
      <p class="mb-4">Don't let the name intimidate you! Computational thinking isn't about thinking like a computer. It's a powerful way of solving problems that computers can understand. By teaching it to our children, we give them a superpower for life, not just for coding.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">At its heart, computational thinking is a problem-solving process that involves four key steps:</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2">1. Decomposition: Breaking It Down</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Imagine your child wants to build a big LEGO castle. They don't just start sticking bricks together randomly. They first think about the different parts: the main tower, the gate, the walls, and the flags. That's decomposition! It's the skill of breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2">2. Pattern Recognition: Finding the Similarities</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Once the problem is broken down, we look for patterns or things that are the same. In the LEGO castle, maybe all the corner towers are built in the exact same way. Recognizing this pattern means you only have to figure out how to build one tower, and then you can repeat that solution for the others.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2">3. Abstraction: Focusing on What's Important</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Abstraction is about ignoring the details that don't matter so you can focus on what does. To design the LEGO castle, you don't need to know the exact color of every single brick right away. You just need to know you need "bricks" for the walls and "flat pieces" for the roof.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2">4. Algorithm Design: Creating the Step-by-Step Plan</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">An algorithm is simply a set of step-by-step instructions for solving a problem. Once you've broken down the problem, found the patterns, and focused on the important parts, you can create a clear plan to build your LEGO castle.</p>

    title: "Decoding the KS2 Computing Curriculum: A Parent's Guide",
    content: `
      <p class="mb-4">The computing curriculum can sound technical, but its goals are simple: to help your child become a safe, creative, and confident user of technology. Here’s a straightforward guide to what your child is learning in Key Stage 2 (ages 7-11) and how you can support them.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The KS2 Computing curriculum is built on three main pillars:</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2">1. Computer Science (CS)</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">This is the "how computers work" part. It’s the core of the curriculum and focuses on computational thinking. They learn to design, write, and debug programs using concepts like sequences, selection (if/then choices), and repetition (loops).</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2">2. Information Technology (IT)</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">This is the "using computers effectively" part. It’s about using technology as a tool to create and organize things. They learn to use search technologies effectively and to select, use, and combine a variety of software to design and create content.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2">3. Digital Literacy</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">This is the "staying safe and responsible online" part. It is arguably the most important pillar. They learn to use technology safely, respectfully, and responsibly, and to know how to get help if they have concerns.</p>

  "algorithms-intro": {
    title: "Algorithms Aren't Scary: A Simple Introduction",
    content: `
      <p class="mb-4">The word "algorithm" is used a lot these days, but it’s not as complicated as it sounds. An algorithm is simply a list of step-by-step instructions to complete a task. You use them every single day!</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Think about it:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4">
        <li>A <strong>recipe</strong> for making a sandwich is an algorithm.</li>
        <li>The <strong>directions</strong> you follow to get to a friend's house is an algorithm.</li>
        <li>The <strong>morning routine</strong> you follow is an algorithm.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">A fun way to teach this to your child is to pretend they are a "Human Robot." Your task is to guide them from one side of the room to the other using only simple commands like MOVE FORWARD, TURN LEFT, and TURN RIGHT. This shows why computers need specific instructions.</p>

    title: "How to Talk to Your Child About Coding",
    content: `
      <p class="mb-4">Starting a conversation about coding can feel daunting if you're not a tech expert. But you don't need to be! Your curiosity and encouragement are the most powerful tools you have. Here are a few simple ways to start the conversation.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2">1. Focus on Creativity, Not Just Code</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Ask: "What do you want to <strong>make</strong> today?" instead of "Do you want to do some coding?" Connect it to their interests, whether it's gaming, art, or storytelling.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2">2. Be the "Enthusiastic Beginner" Together</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">You don't have to be the expert. Learn alongside them. Your presence and interest are what matter most. Model a positive attitude towards mistakes by saying things like, "That's interesting! Let's be detectives and figure out why it didn't work."</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2">3. Ask Open-Ended Questions</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Get them to explain their thinking process. "What was the hardest part?" or "What part are you most proud of?"</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-2">4. Celebrate the Process, Not Just the Result</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Praise the effort and the resilience they show. "I'm so impressed with how you stuck with that problem and didn't give up."</p>
